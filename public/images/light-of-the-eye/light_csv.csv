"Under the Calm of the Eye’s Lowered Lid
",26 x 20in.,"Acrylic ink, india ink, alcohol ink, and wax pastel on YUPO synthetic paper",$2200.00,"Is he someone who dwells in this single world? No:
both realms are the source of his earthly power.
He alone who has known the roots of the willow
can bend the willow-branch into a lyre.
Overnight leave no bread on the table
and leave no milk:they draw back the dead–,
But he, the conjurer, may he settle
under the calm of the eye’s lowered lid
to mix death into everything seen;
and may the magic of earth smoke and rue
be as real to him as the clearest connection.
Nothing can trouble the dominance of
the true image. Whether from graves or from rooms,
let him praise finger-ring, bracelet, and jug.

Be Ahead of All Parting,30 x 22in.,Watercolor and wax pastel on paper,,"Be ahead of all parting, as though it already were
behind you, like the winter that has just gone by.
For among these winters there is one so endlessly winter
that only by wintering through it all will your heart survive.

Be forever dead in Eurydice-more gladly arise
into the seamless life proclaimed in your song.
Here, in the realm of decline, among momentary days,
be the crystal cup that shattered even as it rang.

Be-and yet know the great void where all things begin,
the infinite source of your own most intense vibration,
so that, this once, you may give it your perfect assent.

To all that is used-up, and to all the muffled and dumb
creatures in the world's full reserve, the unsayable sums,
joyfully add yourself, and cancel the count.
